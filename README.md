## Project: Yeram

## Overview
I have created this project for transport companies. Each company can have an account where they can view analytics on passenger traffic for each of their vehicles, perform calculations, and watch or download videos from inside the vehicles. They can also download reports on passenger traffic in PDF, XLS, and CSV formats.
The actions of obtaining reports about the vehicles, downloading files, authentication, and other actions were implemented by integrating with the backend according to the backend documentation.

I developed this project using Next.js, SASS for styling, and Redux Toolkit for state management. I converted the designs from a Figma file. Unfortunately, I cannot share a link to the deployed project due to an agreement with the owner.
